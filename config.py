"""
Central configuration for Reflex Guard.

On the real Snapdragon UNO Q submission, the vision pipeline runs on the
Dragonwing QRB2210 (Linux side) and the safety cutoff runs on the STM32U585
real-time core. This prototype runs both on a Raspberry Pi for development —
`src/safety/realtime_core.py` is written as an isolated thread with its own
timing loop specifically so that swapping it for real STM32 firmware later
is a drop-in replacement, not a redesign.
